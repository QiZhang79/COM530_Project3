        <p> Hi, my name is Qi Zhang. I'm a currently a  graduate student majored in 
        Information Architecture. And I hope to be a web designer after I graduate.</p>
        <p> I studied Advertising during my undergraduate period. Although I was not 
        an engineer or science background student, my interdisciplinary background 
        still helps me a lot.
        For instance, my undergraduate major experience helped me to develop a 
        sense of choosing attractive things, which pushed me to keep high 
        standards for my own web design.</p>
        <p> I have two important turning points for my career goal. The first one 
        happened in my third year in university. My friend asked me whether I was 
        interested to join a mobile app development team, and I could do UE and 
        Product Management work. I feel lucky right now since I choose to accept 
        the invitation at that moment which helped me to get in touch with those 
        web/software things. So with the experience in that team, I became a real 
        product manager after I graduated and my first work lasted one year.</p>

        <p>The one-year product manager work was not that cheerful. My boss pushed me
         a lot and I always stayed up late without extra pay. And my PM team had a
        bad relationship with developer team which made me disappointed. I thought
         to study aboard and learning what I didn't know is a challenge/opportunity.
        So I made my mind from the end of 2015.</p>
        <p> Around this time last year, I didn't have a very clear career goal. But one
         day, I browsed my friend's own website and he showed me lots of tricks. I 
         suddenly these found attractive things were so interesting. And combining 
         with the current market, I thought why not to be a web designer. So I 
         chose to register web design relative classes and self-studied.</p>
        <p>  This summer break, I had an internship in a local start up(<a href="https://www.fire-extinguisher.net/">Pyroweb.net</a>) working as front-end
        designer. Every time I finished the assignments, I felt very satisfied. 
        This experience really made me affirm my choice for sure.</p>
